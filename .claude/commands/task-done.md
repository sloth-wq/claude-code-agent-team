# Task Completion with Intelligent Handoffs

**CORE PURPOSE**: Execute comprehensive task validation, automatic dependency resolution, and seamless workflow transitions.

## Usage
```
/task-done "Completed task name" [--validation-level=strict|standard]
```

## Prerequisites
- Task in `in_progress` status in TodoWrite
- Clear completion deliverables defined

## Outputs
- Quality validation and dependency unblocking
- Next task recommendations and performance analytics
- **OUTPUT FILES**: 
  - `agent-docs/EPIC-{ID}-{epic-name}/validation/quality-reports.md`
  - `agent-docs/EPIC-{ID}-{epic-name}/validation/completion-status.md`

## Quality Validation

### Technical Quality Gates
- Code quality: ESLint/TSLint compliance, test coverage â‰¥80%
- Security: Vulnerability scan clearance, security standards
- Performance: Benchmark achievement, optimization validation
- Business: All acceptance criteria satisfied, design system compliance

### 7-Agent Cross-Validation
All agents validate task completion from their specialized perspective:
- **Backend**: API contracts, database integration, TDD compliance
- **Frontend**: Component standards, state management, accessibility
- **Test**: Coverage goals, quality gates, regression analysis
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment readiness, security, monitoring
- **Database**: Data integrity, performance optimization
- **Code Comprehension**: Architecture quality, technical debt
- **Product Owner**: Business value realization, acceptance criteria

## Dependency Resolution

### Automatic Unblocking Analysis
When a task completes, automatically analyze:
- **Direct dependencies**: Tasks immediately unblocked
- **Indirect impacts**: Tasks affected downstream  
- **Parallel opportunities**: Tasks that can now run concurrently

Example: "User Auth API" completion unblocks:
- Login UI implementation (frontend)
- Auth middleware tests (agile-test)  
- JWT deployment setup (aws-infrastructure)

### Agent Notification System
Each agent automatically notifies relevant agents when completing tasks:
- **Backend** â†’ Frontend (API contracts), Database (schema), Infrastructure (deploy needs)
- **Frontend** â†’ Backend (data requirements), Test (UI scenarios), Product (UX feedback)
- **Test** â†’ All agents (quality results), Product Owner (release readiness)
- **Infrastructure** â†’ All agents (deployment constraints), Product Owner (cost impacts)
- **Database** â†’ Backend/Frontend (schema changes), Infrastructure (resource needs)
- **Code Comprehension** â†’ All agents (architecture guidance), Product Owner (feasibility)
- **Product Owner** â†’ All agents (requirements clarification, priority adjustments)

## Next Task Selection & Handoffs

### AI-Driven Task Selection
Intelligent selection algorithm considering:
- Dependency unblocking (40% weight)
- Context preservation (25% weight)  
- Business value (20% weight)
- Risk mitigation (10% weight)
- Team capacity (5% weight)

### Seamless Handoffs
1. **Completing Agent**: Generate deliverable summary, document implementation details
2. **Next Agent**: Auto-receive context, verify dependencies, set up work environment  
3. **All Agents**: Share progress, update blockers, identify collaboration opportunities

## Performance Analytics

### Real-Time Progress Dashboard
