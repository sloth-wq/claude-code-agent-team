# Comprehensive Epic Retrospective

**CORE PURPOSE**: Conduct data-driven Epic retrospective with 7-agent insights and continuous improvement recommendations.

## Usage
```
/retrospective [epic-name]
```

## Prerequisites
- Epic tasks completed via `/task-done`
- Performance data from `/start-tasks` execution
- Quality metrics from validation phase

## Outputs
- Data-driven improvement recommendations
- Collaboration efficiency analysis
- Process optimization proposals
- **OUTPUT FILES**: 
  - `agent-docs/EPIC-{ID}-{epic-name}/analysis/retrospective-data.md`
  - `agent-docs/EPIC-{ID}-{epic-name}/analysis/metrics.md`

## Retrospective Intelligence

**AUTO-INITIALIZATION**: Load `agent-docs/knowledge.md` and `agent-docs/try.md` for:
- Pattern analysis and improvement tracking
- Knowledge usage effectiveness evaluation
- Try item implementation success measurement

## 7-Agent Retrospective Roles

- **agile-product-owner**: Business value realization, stakeholder satisfaction analysis
- **backend-architect**: API quality metrics, TDD effectiveness, technical performance
- **frontend-architect**: UI/UX outcomes, component reusability, user experience metrics
- **agile-test-strategist**: Quality gates, test effectiveness, risk mitigation success
- **aws-infrastructure-architect**: Infrastructure efficiency, deployment reliability
- **database-design-specialist**: Data model performance, query optimization results
- **product-code-comprehension-expert**: Code quality evolution, technical debt management

## Retrospective Execution Framework

### Automatic Data Collection
- Task completion rates and timing analysis
- Quality gate pass/fail metrics
- Agent collaboration efficiency scores  
- Knowledge base usage effectiveness
- Try item implementation success rates

### Multi-Agent KPT Analysis

**Keep**: Quantified success factors with measured impact
**Problem**: Bottlenecks with time impact and root cause analysis  
**Try**: Specific improvement initiatives with success metrics

## Output Structure

### Epic Performance Analysis
- Completion metrics vs targets with variance analysis
- Quality achievements and improvement gaps
- Business value delivery assessment with ROI metrics

### Agent Collaboration Insights  
- Individual contribution metrics and efficiency patterns
- Cross-agent handoff effectiveness analysis
- Communication pattern optimization opportunities

### Knowledge Base Evolution
**Auto-update `agent-docs/knowledge.md`**:
- Usage statistics and effectiveness ratings for existing knowledge
- New learnings and patterns discovered during Epic
- Knowledge gap identification and filling recommendations

**Auto-update `agent-docs/try.md`**:
- Try item implementation success/failure analysis
- Progress updates with quantified impact measurements
- New improvement proposals based on retrospective insights

### Continuous Improvement Pipeline
Generate prioritized recommendations for:
- Immediate process adjustments for next Epic
- Knowledge sharing and cross-training opportunities  
- Tool/technology improvements with expected ROI
- Long-term strategic process evolution

## Success Measurement
- Try item implementation rate (target: >70%)
- Process efficiency improvement trends
- Knowledge base utilization effectiveness
- Agent collaboration satisfaction scores

The retrospective maintains the established 7-agent collaboration model while automatically evolving the knowledge-driven development approach for sustained improvement.
